# CodSoft Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for my CodSoft internship projects! During my internship as an Application Development Engineer at CodSoft (from July 25, 2024, to August 24, 2024), I worked on several exciting projects that helped me hone my skills in C++ programming and software development. Below is an overview of each project, including the purpose, features, and instructions for running the code.

## Project 1: Simple Calculator (Task-2)

### Overview
The Simple Calculator is a console-based application written in C++ that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was one of the first tasks I completed during my internship, and it helped me solidify my understanding of basic C++ syntax and operations.

### Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that users enter valid numerical inputs.
- **Error Handling:** Handles division by zero gracefully.

### Files
- `simpleCalculator.cpp`: The source code for the calculator.
- `simpleCalculator.exe`: The executable file for running the calculator.

### How to Run
1. Compile the `simpleCalculator.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the generated executable (`simpleCalculator.exe`) to use the calculator.

## Project 2: To-Do List Manager (Task-4)

### Overview
The To-Do List Manager is a console-based application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Written in C++, this project focuses on data structures, specifically using a `Task` struct to organize tasks and various functions to manage them.

### Features
- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **View Tasks:** Display all current tasks with their status (completed or pending).
- **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed once they are done.
- **Remove Tasks:** Delete tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple menu-driven interface for ease of use.

### Files
- `toDoList.cpp`: The source code for the To-Do List Manager.
- `toDoList.exe`: The executable file for running the To-Do List Manager.

### How to Run
1. Compile the `toDoList.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the generated executable (`toDoList.exe`) to start managing your tasks.

## Project 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Task-3)

### Overview
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a console-based C++ application that allows two players to enjoy a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This project was particularly fun to develop as it involved implementing game logic and creating a dynamic, interactive experience.

### Features
- **Personalized Player Names:** Players can enter their names, which are displayed during the game.
- **Dynamic Game Board:** The game board updates after each move, showing the current state of the game.
- **Win Detection:** Automatically detects and announces the winner, or declares a draw if applicable.
- **Fun Messages:** Displays a fun message like "Let's give a pizza to yourself!" when a player wins.

### Files
- `ticTacToeGame.cpp`: The source code for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `ticTacToeGame.exe`: The executable file for playing the game.

### How to Run
1. Compile the `ticTacToeGame.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the generated executable (`ticTacToeGame.exe`) to play Tic-Tac-Toe.
